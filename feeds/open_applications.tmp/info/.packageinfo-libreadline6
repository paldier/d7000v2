Description: 	The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications 
	that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs 
	and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes 
	additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command 
	lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like 
	history expansion on previous commands.
