License: GPL-2.0
Type: ipkg
Description:  This package contains the small resolveip utility which
 can be used by scripts to turn host names into numeric
 IP addresses. It supports IPv4 and IPv6 resolving and
 has a configurable timeout to guarantee a certain maximum
 runtime in case of slow or defunct DNS servers.
