Zip 3.0

We have posted Zip 3.0, July 5th 2008.  This is a major upgrade
from Zip 2.32, the current Zip 2.x release.  A quick summary of
features is below, but see the file WhatsNew for the detailed list
of major features and upgrades as well as what's on the list for
Zip 3.1.  Send in your feature suggestions and bug reports.

Quick list of major changes in Zip 3.0:

- Large files.  Support for files and archives greater than 2 GB using
  large file I/O and the Zip64 extensions.  Also can now have more
  than 64K entries in an archive.

- Split archives.  Zip now supports split archives, zip archives
  split into a set of files that can then be stored on removable media
  for instance.

- Unicode.  If Unicode support is enabled and supported on the system
  Zip is run on, Zip now can read paths not in the current character
  set and store those paths in portable UTF-8 format.  These Unicode
  paths can then be used to partially or fully recreate the paths on
  other systems depending on the character set support provided by
  the unzip on the receiving system.  In particular, this allows
  portability of paths between Windows and Unix.  Unicode comments
  are also supported on systems where UTF-8 is the current character
  set.  Unicode comment support for other systems is expected in
  Zip 3.1.

- New command line parser.  This new parser allows for command line
  permuting, where options can appear almost anywhere on the command
  line.  This allows adding options to the end of the command line,
  for instance.  It also supports long options, allowing for
  more readable command lines, and also allows lists for the -x
  exclude and -i include options to appear not just at the end of
  the command line.  And some bugs in command line processing in
  Zip 2.32 have been fixed.

- Unix 32-bit UIDs/GIDs.  Now UIDs/GIDs larger than 16 bits are
  supported, but UnZip 6.0 is needed to restore these larger
  UIDs/GIDs.  If Zip detects that the current system does not use
  16-bit UIDs/GIDs, the old 16-bit UID/GID storage is not used
  as putting 32-bit UIDs/GIDs into 16-bit fields can cause
  problems.

- New modes.  Additional archive modes have been added, including a
  difference mode for supporting incremental backups, a file sync
  mode for synchronizing an existing archive with the current file
  system (which can be much faster than creating a new archive), and
  a copy mode that allows copying entries from one archive to another.

- Compression using bzip2.  Now can add bzip2 compression as a
  compression option in Zip.  bzip2 compression can result in much
  more compact entries in some cases, but the user should verify
  that bzip2 is supported on the target unzip before using this new
  compression choice.

- New Windows dll.  The Windows dll has been updated to support the
  new Zip64 large file and larger number of entries limits.  This
  new dll is not backward compatible with the Zip 2.32 dll, as the
  arguments to the dll have been updated to support the added
  capabilities, but modifying existing programs to use the new dll
  should be simple.  See the included Visual Basic example project
  for details.

- Better streaming and piping.  Zip now has better support of
  streaming and piping and handles Unix FIFOs (named pipes) better.

- Gobs of new progress information.  Zip can now output progress
  information, such as how many entries processed and to go, how
  many bytes processed and to go, and adjustable size progress
  dots.  If the initial file scan takes longer than about 5
  seconds, Zip now outputs dots during the scan to avoid a long
  period of quiet.  Zip can also now generate log files.

- Updated archive fixing.  The archive fixing capability is
  slightly improved, and now can fix split archives.

- Windows Archive bit support.  The Windows archive bit is now
  supported, though the new difference mode is probably more
  reliable than relying on the Windows archive bit for creating
  incremental backups.

- File lists.  Zip can list the files that would be added to an
  archive as well as the files in an existing archive.

- Extended help.  A new extended help option lists a very terse
  summary of the major features of Zip and how to use them.

- Many bug fixes.

As always, see the Zip manual page for details on what Zip has and
how to use all features.

Enjoy!
