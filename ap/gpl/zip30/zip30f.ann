Zip 3.0f

We have posted Zip Beta 3.0f, September 24th 2007.  This is a beta
release, but is more or less complete.  See the file WhatsNew for
a list of major features implemented and what's left.

The archive reading and writing code in this beta has been redone to
support split archives.  We've extensively tested the code over the
last year, but you should thoroughly test it yourself before relying
on it.  Also note that Unicode support is preliminary and may change
before release, but currently there seems agreement between Info-ZIP
and others on how to handle storing UTF-8 paths and that approach is
implemented in Zip 3.0.

Please test this beta and let us know if we're ready to officially
release Zip 3.0.

New things in Zip 3.0f
- Split archives - Zip now can create and indirectly update split
  archives
- Unicode support - Zip now stores Unicode paths that should be more
  portable across character sets and languages and Zip now can
  read Windows file names in most all character sets using Unicode,
  but this support is preliminary and may change by release
- bzip2 - bzip2 compression is now supported
- Console writing - Messages to the console are more consistently
  formatted
- Streaming - Directories are now handled better when streaming
- Date range - Can now use -t and -tt to set a date range
- UnZip Check - Check if UnZip 6.00 or later is available for
  testing a Zip64 archive
- License - minor updates to the license
- Difference mode - A new option -DF (--dif) creates an output archive that
  includes only files changed or added since the input archive was created,
  and might be useful for incremental backups
- File Sync - New option -FS synchronizes the entries in an archive with the
  files on the file system, adding, updating, and deleting entries as needed,
  creating an updated archive that should be the same as a new archive, but
  since existing entries are copied and not recompressed it can be faster
- Fix options - Options -F and -FF now fix split archives
- Copy Mode - This new mode allows selecting archive entries to copy
  to a new archive
- Case matching - On Windows and VMS, option -ic (ignore case) turns off
  case-sensitive matching of command line input patterns when matching
  entries in an archive
- Windows OEM - With this compile option, file names are saved on
  Windows in the local OEM character set, as some other zips do
- Windows Archive Bit support - On Windows can now select files
  using the Windows archive bit
- Global dots - Can now set quiet mode, but output progress dots every
  so many bytes read, settable from KB to TB, allowing progress to be
  displayed for large archives without the screen scrolling
- Empty archives - Options -i or -i@ can now output empty archives,
  which is useful in some scripts
- Keep extra fields option - Option -X- allows passing through extra
  fields that Zip does not process
- Large file encryption bug fixed - Fix for bug that very rarely
  results in bad data being stored when deflating and encrypting
  uncompressable large amounts of data and resulting in CRC errors
- Show Files option - Can list the files that would be operated on
- Delete date bug fixed - Bug when using -d with -t or -tt is fixed
