Zip 3.0g

We have posted Zip Beta 3.0g, January 30th 2008.  This is a beta
release, but is more or less complete and is considered a release
candidate.  See the file WhatsNew for a list of major features
implemented and what's left.

The archive reading and writing code in Zip 3.0 has been redone to
support split archives.  We've extensively tested the code over the
last year, but you should thoroughly test it yourself before relying
on it.  Also note that Unicode support has been added and should comply
with the latest AppNote, but is still new and so may need refining.

Please test this beta and let us know if we're ready to officially
release Zip 3.0.

New things in Zip 3.0g
- Add split support to VB project for Zip64.

- Disable reading of Unix FIFOs unless new -FI option used to avoid an
  archiving operation stopping when it hits an active unfed FIFO.

- The [list] wildcard expression (regular expression matching of any
  character or range of characters in list) is now disabled on DOS and
  Windows as it has caused confusion when filenames have [ and ] in
  them.  The new -RE option reenables it.

- Add negation to many display options such as -dc and -db.

- Allow -FF to read and fix archives having local entries that appear
  after central directory entries.

- Many small bug fixes.
