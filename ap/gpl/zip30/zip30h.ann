Zip 3.0h

We have posted Zip Beta 3.0h, May 31st 2008.  This is a beta
release, but is more or less complete and is considered a release
candidate.  See the file WhatsNew for a list of major features
implemented and what's left.

The archive reading and writing code in Zip 3.0 has been redone to
support split archives.  We've extensively tested the code over the
last year, but you should thoroughly test it yourself before relying
on it.  Also note that Unicode support has been added and should comply
with the latest AppNote, but is still new and so may need refining.

Please test this beta and let us know if we're ready to officially
release Zip 3.0.
