release 0.4 - initial public release

release 0.5 - added caching, removed compiler warning on linux PPC

release 0.6 - TCP handling: close socket and return to connect state if we 
              can't read the first byte. This corrects a problem seen very 
              occasionally where dnsmasq would loop using all available CPU.

	      Added a patch from Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@e-secure.com.au>
	      to set SO_REUSEADDR on the tcp socket which stops problems when
              dnsmasq is restarted and old connections still exist.

	      Stopped claiming in doc.html that smail is the default Debian
	      mailer, since it isn't any longer. (Pointed out by
	      David Karlin <dkarlin@coloradomtn.edu>)

release 0.7   Create a pidfile at /var/run/dnsmasq.pid

	      Extensive armouring against "poison packets" courtesy of
              Thomas Moestl <tmoestl@gmx.net>

	      Set sockaddr.sa_family on outgoing address, patch from
	      David Symonds <xoxus@usa.net>

              Patch to clear cache on SIGHUP 
	      from Jason L. Wagner <nialscorva@yahoo.com> 

	      Fix bad bug resulting from not initialising value-result	
	      address-length parameter to recvfrom() and accept() - it
	      worked by luck before!

release 0.95  Major rewrite: remove calls to gethostbyname() and talk
              directly to the upstream server(s) instead.
              This has many advantages.
              (1) Dnsmasq no longer blocks during long lookups.
              (2) All query types are handled now, (eg MX) not just internet
                  address queries. Addresses are cached, all other
                  queries are forwarded directly.
              (3) Time-to-live data from upstream server is read and
                  used by dnsmasq to purge entries from the cache.
              (4) /etc/hosts is still read and its contents served (unless 
	          the -h option is given).
              (5) Dnsmasq can get its upstream servers from
                  a file other than /etc/resolv.conf (-r option) this allows
                  dnsmasq to serve names to the machine it is running
                  on (put nameserver 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf and
                  give dnsmasq the option -r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq)
              (6) Dnsmasq will re-read it's servers if the
                  modification time of resolv.conf changes. Along with
                  4 above this allows nameservers to be set
		  automatically by ppp or dhcp.	 

              A really clever NAT-like technique allows the daemon to have lots
              of queries in progress, but still remain very lightweight.
	      Dnsmasq has a small footprint and normally doesn't allocate
              any more memory after start-up. The NAT-like forwarding was
              inspired by a suggestion from Eli Chen <eli@routefree.com>

release 0.96  Fixed embarrasing thinko in cache linked-list code.
                             
release 0.98  Some enhancements and bug-fixes. 
              Thanks to "Denis Carre" <denis.carre@laposte.net> and Martin 
              Otte <otte@essc.psu.edu>	
              
	      (1) Dnsmasq now always sets the IP source address
                  of its replies correctly. Older versions would not always
                  do this on multi-homed and IP aliased hosts, which violates 
                  the RFC.
              (2) Dnsmasq no longer crashes if a server loop is created
	          (ie dnsmasq is told to use itself as an upstream server.)
                  Now it just logs the problem and doesn't use the bad 
                  server address.
              (3) Dnsmasq should now forward (but not cache) inverse queries 
                  and server status queries; this feature has not been tested.
              (4) Don't write the pid file when in non-daemon mode.
	      (5) Create the pid file mode 644, rather then 666 (!).
              (6) Generate queries to upstream nameservers with unpredictable
                  ids, to thwart DNS spoofers.
              (7) Dnsmasq no longer forwards queries when the 
	          "recursion desired" bit is not set in the header.
	      (8) Fixed getopt code to work on compliers with unsigned char.
              
release 0.991 Added -b flag: when set causes dnsmasq to always answer
	      reverse queries on the RFC 1918 private IP space itself and
              never forward them to an upstream server. If the name is not in
	      /etc/hosts, dnsmasq replies with the dotted-quad address.
              
              Fixed a bug which stopped dnsmasq working on a box with
              two or more interfaces with the same IP address. 

              Fixed cacheing of CNAMEs. Previously, a CNAME which pointed
              to  a name with many A records would not have all the addresses
              returned when being answered from the cache.

	      Thanks to "Steve Hardy" <s.a.hardy@connectux.com> for his input 
              on these fixes.

              Fixed race which could cause dnsmasq to miss the second of
              two closely-spaced updates of resolv.conf (Thanks to Eli Chen
              for pointing this out.)

	      Fixed a bug which could cause dnsmasq to fail to cache some
              dns names.

release 0.992 Small change to memory allocation so that names in /etc/hosts
              don't use cache slots. Also make "-c 0" flag meaningfully 
              disable caching completely.                            

release 0.993 Return only the first (canonical) name from an entry in
	      /etc/hosts as reply to reverse query.
              
              Handle wildcard queries for names/addresses in /etc/hosts
	      this is mainly to allow reverse lookups by dig to succeed.
	      (Bug reported by Simon J. Rowe" <srowe@mose.org.uk>)  
              
              Subtle change to the logic which selects which of multiple
	      upstream servers we send queries to. This fixes a problem 
              where dnsmasq continuously sends queries to a server which
	      is returning error codes and ignores one which is working.
              
release 0.994 Fixed bug which broke lookup of names in /etc/hosts
              which have upper-case letters in them. Thanks for Joao Clemente
              for spotting that one. 

	      Output cache statistics on receipt of SIGUSR1. These go
              to syslog except in debug (-d) mode, when a complete cache
	      dump goes to stdout. Suggestion from Joao Clemente, code
              based in John Volpe's.
              
	      Accept GNU long options on the command line. Code from 
	      John Volpe for this. 

              Split source code into multiple files and produced 
	      a proper makefile. 
              
              Included code from John Volpe to parse dhcp.leases file
              written by ISC dhcpd. The hostnames in the leases file are
              added to the cache and updated as dhcpd updates the 
              leases file. The code has been heavily re-worked by me,
              so any bugs are probably mine.

release 0.995 Small tidy-ups to signal handling and cache code.

release 0.996 Added negative caching: If dnsmasq gets a "no such domain" reply
              from an upstream nameserver, it will cache that information
              for a time specified by the SOA RR in the reply. See RFC 2308
              for details. This is useful with  resolver libraries
              which append assorted suffices to non-FQDN in an attempt to 
              resolve them, causing useless cache misses.

              Added -i flag, which restricts dnsmasq to offering name service
              only on specified interfaces.

release 0.997 Deleted INSTALL script and added "install" target to makefile.

              Stopped distributing binaries in the tarball to avoid 
              libc version clashes.

              Fixed  interface detection code to
              remove spurious startup errors in rare circumstances.

              Dnsmasq now changes its uid, irrevocably, to nobody after
              startup for security reasons. Thanks to Peter Bailey for
              this patch.

	      Cope with infinite DHCP leases. Patch thanks to 
	      Yaacov Akiba Slama.

	      Added rpm control files to .tar.gz distribution. Thanks to
              Peter Baldwin at ClarkConnect for those.

              Improved startup script for rpms. Thanks to Yaacov Akiba Slama.

release 1.0   Stable release: dnsmasq is now considered feature-complete
              and stable.
              
release 1.1   Added --user argument to allow user to change to
              a different userid.

              Added --mx-target argument to allow mail to be delivered
              away from the gateway machine running dnsmasq.

              Fixed highly  obscure bug with wildcard queries for
              DHCP lease derived names.

              Moved manpage from section 1 to section 8.

              Added --no-poll option.
              Added Suse-rpm support.
              Thanks to Joerg Mayer for the last two.

release 1.2   Added IPv6 DNS record support. AAAA records are cached
              and read from /etc/hosts. Reverse-lookups in the
	      ip6.int and ip6.arpa domains are suppored. Dnsmasq can
              talk to upstream servers via IPv6 if it finds IP6 addresses
              in /etc/resolv.conf and it offers DNS service automatically
              if IPv6 support is present in the kernel.

              Extended negative caching to NODATA replies.

              Re-vamped CNAME processing to cope with RFC 2317's use of
              CNAMES to PTR RRs in CIDR.

              Added config.h and a couple of symbols to aid
              compilation on non-linux systems.

release 1.3   Some versions of the Linux kernel return EINVAL rather
              then ENPROTONOSUPPORT when IPv6 is not available, 
              causing dnsmasq to bomb out. This release fixes that.
              Thanks to Steve Davis for pointing this one out.

              Trivial change to startup logic so that dnsmasq logs
              its stuff and reads config files straight away on
              starting, rather than after the first query - principle 
              of least surprise applies here.     

release 1.4   Fix a bug with DHPC lease parsing which broke in
              non-UTC timezones. Thanks to Mark Wormgoor for
              spotting and diagnosing this. Fixed versions in
              the .spec files this time. Fixed bug in Suse startup
              script. Thanks to Didi Niklaus for pointing this out.

release 1.5   Added --filterwin2k option which stops dnsmasq from forwarding
	      "spam" queries from win2k boxes. This is useful to stop spurious
              connections over dial-on-demand links. Thanks to Steve Hardy 
              for this code.

              Clear "truncated" bit in replies we return from upstream. This
              stops resolvers from switching to TCP, which is pointless since
              dnsmasq doesn't support TCP. This should solve problems
              in resolving hotmail.com domains.

              Don't include getopt.h when Gnu-long-options are disabled -
              hopefully this will allow compilation on FreeBSD.

	      Added the --listen-address and --pid-file flags.

              Fixed a bug which caused old entries in the DHCP leases file
              to be used in preference to current ones under certain
              circumstances.

release 1.6   If a machine gets named via DHCP and the DHCP name doesn't have
              a domain part and domain suffix is set using the -s flag, then
              that machine has two names with the same address, with and 
              without the domain suffix. When doing a _reverse_ lookup to
              get the name, the "without suffix" name used to be returned,
              now the "with suffix" one gets returned instead. This change
	      suggested by Arnold Schulz.

              Fixed assorted typos in the documentation. Thanks 
              to David Kimdon.

              Subtle rearrangement to the downloadable tarball, and stopped
              distributing .debs, since dnsmasq is now an official Debian
              package.

release 1.7   Fix a problem with cache not clearing properly
              on receipt of SIGHUP. Bug spotted by Sat Deshpande.

              In group-id changing code:
	      1) Drop supplimentary groups.
              2) Change gid before dropping root (patch from Soewono Effendi.)
              3) Change group to "dip" if it exists, to allow access
                 to /etc/ppp/resolv.conf (suggestion from Jorg Sommer.)
              Update docs to reflect above changes.

              Other documentation changes from David Miller.
              Added suggested script fragment for dhcpcd.exe.

release 1.8   Fix unsafe use of tolower() macro - allows linking against 
              ulibc. (Patches from Soewono Effendi and Bjorn Andersson.)

              Fix typo in usage string.

	      Added advice about RedHat PPP configuration to
              documentation. (Thanks to C. Lee Taylor.)

	      Patches to fix problems on BSD systems from Marc Huber
              and Can Erkin Acar. These add the options
              HAVE_ARC4RANDOM and HAVE_SOCKADDR_SA_LEN to config.h.
	      Elaborated config.h - should really use autoconf.

	      Fix time-to-live calculation when chasing CNAMEs.

	      Fix use-after-free and missing initialisation bugs in
              the cache code. (Thanks to Marc Huber.)

              Builds on Solaris 9. (Thanks to Marc Huber.)           

release 1.9   Fixes to rpm .spec files.

              Don't put expired DHCP entries into the cache only to 
	      throw them away again.

              Put dnsmasq on a severe memory diet: this reduces both
              the amount of heap space used and the stack size
              required. The difference is not really visible with
              bloated libcs like glibc, but should dramatically reduce
              memory requirements when linked against ulibc for use on
              embeded routers, and that's the point really. Thanks to
              Matthew Natalier for prompting this.   

	      Changed debug mode (-d) so that all logging appears on
              stderr as well as going to syslogd. 

	      Added HAVE_IPV6 config symbol to allow compilation
              against a libc which doesn't have IPv6 support.

	      Added a facility to log all queries, enabled with -q flag.

	      Fixed packet size checking bug in address extraction code.

	      Halved default cache size - 300 was way OTT in typical use.

	      Added self-MX function, enabled by -e flag. Thanks to
              Lyonel Vincent for the patch.

	      Added HAVE_FORK config symbol and stuff to support
              uClinux. Thanks to Matthew Natalier for uClinux stuff. 

release 1.10  Log warnings if resolv.conf or dhcp.leases are not
              accessable for any reason, as suggested by Hinrich Eilts.

	      Fixed wrong address printing in error message about
	      no interface with address.

	      Updated docs and split installation instuctions into setup.html.

	      Fix bug in CNAME chasing code: One CNAME pointing
	      to many A records would lose A records after the 
	      first. This bug was introduced in version 1.9.

	      Log startup failures at level Critical as well as 
	      printing them to standard error.
	      Exit with return code 1 when given bad options.

	      Cleaned up code for no-cache operation.

              Added -o option which forces dnsmasq to use to
              upstream servers in the order they appear in /etc/resolv.conf.

              Added upstream server use logging.

              Log full cache dump on receipt of SIGUSR1 when query 
              logging is enabled (-q switch).

	      Added -S option to directly specify upstream servers and
              added ability to direct queries for specific domains to
              specfic servers. Suggested by Jens Vonderheide.

	      Upgraded random ID generation - patch from Rob Funk.	      

	      Fixed reading of domains in arguments with capital
              letters or trailing periods.

	      Fixed potential SEGV when given bad options.

	      Read options from /etc/dnsmasq.conf if it exists.
              Do sensible things with missing parameters, eg 
              "--resolv-file=" turns off reading /etc/resolv.conf.

release 1.11  Actually implement the -R flag promised in the 1.10 man page.

              Improve and rationalise the return codes in answers to
              queries. In the case that there are no available
              upstream servers to forward a query to, return REFUSED.
              This makes sendmail work better on modem connected
              systems when the modem link is down (Thanks to Roger Plant).
	      Cache and return the NXDOMAIN status of failed queries:
              this makes the `host` command work when traversing search
              paths (Thanks to Peter Bailey). Set the "authoritative"
              bit in replies containing names from /etc/hosts or DHCP.

              Tolerate MS-DOS style line ending codes in /etc/hosts
	      and /etc/resolv.conf, for people who copy from winsock
              installations.

	      Allow specification of more than one resolv.conf file. This is 
              intended for laptops which connect via DHCP or
              PPP. Whichever resolv.conf was updated last is used.

              Allow -S flags which specify a domain but no server
              address. This gives local domains which are never forwarded.

	      Add -E flag to automatically add the domain suffix to
              names in /etc/hosts -suggestion from Phil Harman.

	      Always return a zero time-to-live for names derived from 
	      DHCP which stops anthing else caching these
              names. Previously the TTL was derived from the lease
              time but that is incorrect since a lease can be given
              up early: dnsmasq would know this but anything with the
              name cached with long TTL would not be updated.

	      Extended HAVE_IPV6 config flag to allow compliation on
	      old systems which don't have modern library routines
	      like inet_ntop(). Thanks to Phil Harman for the patch.

release 1.12  Allow more than one domain in server config lines and
	      make "local" a synonym for "server". This makes things
	      like "local=/localnet/thekelleys.org.uk/" legal. Allow
              port to specified as part of server address.

	      Allow whole domains to have an IP address specified
              in /etc/dnsmasq.conf. (/etc/hosts doesn't work domains).
              address=/doubleclick.net/127.0.0.1 should catch all
              those nasty banner ads. Inspired by a patch 
	      from Daniel Gryniewicz

	      Log the source of each query when logging switched on. 

	      Fix bug in script fragment for dhcpcd - thanks to Barry Stewart.
	      
	      Fix bug which meant that strict-order and self-mx were
	      always enabled.

	      Builds with Linux libc5 now - for the Freesco project.

	      Fixed Makefile installation script (patch from Silvan
	      Minghetti) and added CC and CFLAGS variables.

	      Improve resource allocation to reduce vulnerability to
	      DOS attacks - the old version could have all queries
	      blocked by a continuous high-speed stream of
	      queries. Now some queries will succeed, and the excess
	      will be rejected with a server fail error. This change also
	      protects against server-loops; setting up a resolving
              loop between two instances of dnsmasq is no longer
	      catastrophic. The servers will continue to run, looped
	      queries fail and a warning is logged. Thanks to C. Lee
	      Taylor for help with this.
	      
release 1.13  Added support for building rpms suitable for modern Suse 
	      systems. (patch from Andi <cambeis@netplace.de>)
	      
	      Added options --group, --localmx, --local-ttl,
	      --no-negcache, --addn-host.
	      
	      Moved all the various rpm-building bits into /rpm.
	      
	      Fix builds with glibc 2.1 (thanks to Cristian
	      Ionescu-Idbohrn)
	      
	      Preserve case in domain names, as per RFC1035.
	      
	      Fixed ANY queries to domains with --address specification.
	      
	      Fixed FreeBSD build. (thanks to Steven Honson)
	      
	      Added -Q option which allows a specified port to be used
	      to talk to upstream servers. Useful for people who want
	      very paranoid firewalls which open individual UDP port.
	      (thanks to David Coe for the patch)
	      	      
release 1.14  Fixed man page description of -b option which confused 
	      /etc/hosts with /etc/resolv.conf. (thanks to Christopher
	      Weimann)
	      
	      Fixed config.h to allow building under MACOS X and glibc
	      2.0.x. (thanks to Matthew Gregan and Serge Caron)
	      
	      Added --except-interface option. (Suggested by Serge Caron)

	      Added SIGUSR2 facility to re-scan for new
	      interfaces. (Suggested by Serge Caron)

	      Fixed SEGV in option-reading code for invalid options.
	      (Thanks to Klaas Teschauer)

              Fixed man page to clarify effect of SIGUSR1 on
	      /etc/resolv.conf.
	      (Thanks to Klaas Teschauer)
	      
	      Check that recieved queries have only rfc1035-legal characters
	      in them. This check is mainly to avoid bad strings being
	      sent to syslog.

	      Fixed &&/& confusion in option.c and added DESTDIR
	      variable for "make install" (Thanks to Osvaldo 
              Marques for the patch.)

	      Fixed /etc/hosts parsing code to cope with MS-DOS
	      line-ends in the file. This was supposed to be done in
	      version 1.11, but something got missed. (Thanks to Doug
	      Copestake for helping to find this.)

	      Squash repeated name/address pairs read from hosts
	      files.

	      Tidied up resource handling in util.c (Thanks to
	      Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn).

	      Added hashed searching of domain names. People are starting
	      to use dnsmasq with larger loads now, and bigger caches,
	      and large lists of ad-block addresses. This means doing
	      linear searches can start to use lots of CPU so I added hashed
	      searching and seriously optimised the cache code for 
	      algorithmic efficiency. Also upped the limit on cache 
	      size to 10000.

	      Fixed logging of the source of names from the additional
	      hosts file and from the "bogus private address" option.

	      Fixed spurious re-reading of empty lease files. (Thanks
	      to Lewis Baughman for spotting this.)

	      Fixed building under uclibc (patch from Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn)
	      
	      Do some socket tweaking to allow dnsmasq to co-exist
	      with BIND. Thanks to Stefan 'Sec' Zehl for the patch.

release 1.15  Added --bogus-nxdomain option.

              Restrict checking of resolv.conf and DHCP leases files
              to once per second. This is intended to improve
              performance under heavy loads. Also make a system call
	      to get the current time once per query, rather than four
              times.

	      Increased number of outstanding queries to 150 in
	      config.h

release 1.16  Allow "/" characters in domain names - this fixes
              caching of RFC 2317 CNAME-PTR records.

	      Fixed brain-fart in -B option when GETOPT_LONG not
	      enabled - thanks to Steven Young and Jason Miller 
	      for pointing this out.

	      Generalised bogus-nxdomain code: allow more than one
	      address to check, and deal with replies with multiple
	      answer records. (Based on contribution from Humberto
	      Massa.)

	      Updated the documentation to include information about
	      bogus-nxdomain and the Verisign tragedy.

	      Added libraries needed on Solaris to Makefile.

	      Added facility to set source address in queries to
	      upstream nameservers. This is useful with multihomed
	      hosts, especially when using VPNs. Thanks to Tom Fanning
	      for suggesting this feature.

	      Tweaked logging: log to facility LOCAL0 when in
	      debug/no-daemon mode and changed level of query logging
	      from INFO to DEBUG. Make log options controllable in
	      config.h

release 1.17  Fixed crash with DHCP hostnames > 40 characters.

              Fixed name-comparision routines to not depend on Locale,
              in theory this versions since 1.15 could lock up or give
              wrong results when run with locale != 'C'.

	      Fix potential lockup in cache code. (thanks to Henning
	      Glawe for help chasing this down.)

	      Made lease-file reader bullet-proof.

	      Added -D option, suggested by Peter Fichtner.

release 1.18  Added round-robin DNS for names which have more than one
              address. In this case all the addresses will be
              returned, as before, but the order will change on each
              query.

	      Remove stray tolower() and isalnum() calls missed in 
	      last release to complete LOCALE independence.

	      Allow port numbers in source-address specifications.

	      For hostnames without a domain part which don't get
	      forwarded because -D is in effect, return NXDOMAIN not
	      an empty reply.

	      Add code to return the software version in repsonse to the
	      correct magic query in the same way as BIND. Use  
	      "dig version.bind chaos txt" to make the query.

	      Added negative caching for PTR (address to name) records.

	       Ensure that names of the form typically used in PTR queries
              (ie w.x.yz.in-addr.arpa and IPv6 equivalents) get
              correct answers when queried as other types. It's
              unlikely that anyone would do this, but the change makes
              things pedantically correct.

	      Taught dnsmasq to understand "bitstring" names, as these
	      are used for PTR lookups of IPv6 addresses by some 
	      resolvers and lookup tools. Dnsmasq now understands both
	      the ip6.int domain and the ip6.arpa domain and both
	      nibble and bitstring formats so it should work with any
	      client code. Standards for this stuff have flip-flopped
	      over the last few years, leaving many different clients
	      in their wake. See RFC2673 for details of bitstrings.
	      
	      Allow '_' characters in domain names: Legal characters
	      are now [a-z][A-Z].-_ Check names read from hosts files
	      and leases files and reject illegal ones with a message
	      in syslog. 

	      Make empty domain names in server and address options 
	      have the special meaning "unqualified
	      names". (unqualified names are names without any dots in
	      them). It's now possible to do server=//1.2.3.4 and have 
	      unqualified names sent to a special nameserver.

release 2.0rc1  
              Moved source code into src/ directory.

	      Fixes to cure compilation breakage when HAVE_IPV6 not
	      set, thanks to Claas Hilbrecht.

	      BIG CHANGE: added an integrated DHCP server and removed
	      the code to read ISC dhcp.leases. This wins in terms 
	      of ease of setup and configuration flexibility and 
	      total machine resources consumed. 

	      Re-jiged the signal handling code to remove a race
	      condition and to be more portable.

release 2.0
	     Thanks to David Ashworth for feedback which informed many 
	     of the fixes below.

             Allow hosts to be specified by client ID in dhcp-hosts
             options. These are now one of 
             dhcp-host=<hardware addr>,.... 
             dhcp-host=id:<hex client id>,..... 
             dhcp-host=id:<ascii client id>,.....
	     
	     Allow dhcp-host options to specify any IP address on the
             DHCP-served network, not just the range available for
             dynamic allocation.

	     Allow dhcp-host options for the same host with different
	     IP adresses where the correct one will be selected for
	     the network the host appears on.

	     Fix parsing of --dhcp-option to allow more than one
	     IP address and to allow text-type options.	     

	     Inhibit use of --dhcp-option to send hostname DHCP options.
	     
	     Update the DNS with DHCP information after re-reading
	     /etc/hosts so that any DHCP derived names which have been
	     shadowed by now-deleted hosts entries become visible.

	     Fix typos in dnsmasq.conf.example

	     Fixes to Makefile(s) to help pkgsrc packaging - patch 
	     from "pancake".

	     Add dhcp-boot option to support network boot.

	     Check for duplicate IP addresses in dhcp-hosts lines
	     and refuse to run if found. If allowed to remain these 
	     can provoke an infinite loop in the DHCP protocol.

	     Attempted to rationalise the .spec files for rpm
	     building. There are now files for Redhat, Suse and
	     Mandrake. I hope they work OK.

	     Fixed hard-to-reproduce crash involving use of local
	     domains and IPv6 queries. Thanks to Roy Marples for
	     helping to track that one down.

release 2.1  
             Thanks to Matt Swift and Dag Wieers for many suggestions 
	     which went into this release.
	    
	     Tweak include files to allow compilation on FreeBSD 5
             
             Fix unaligned access warnings on BSD/Alpha.

	     Allow empty DHCP options, like so: dhpc-option=44
 
             Allow single-byte DHCP options like so: dhcp-option=20,1

	     Allow comments on the same line as options in
	     /etc/dnsmasq.conf

	     Don't complain when the same name and address is
	     allocated to a host using DHCP and /etc/hosts.
	     
	     Added to the example configuration the dnsmasq equivalent
	     of the ISC dhcpd settings given in 
             http://www.samba.org/samba/ftp/docs/textdocs/DHCP-Server-Configuration.txt

	     Fixed long-existing strangeness in Linux IPv6 interface
	     discovery code. The flags field in /proc/net/if_inet6 is
	     _not_ the interface flags. 

	     Fail gracefully when getting an ENODEV error when trying
	     to bind an IPv6 socket, rather than bailing out. Thanks
	     to Jan Ischebeck for feedback on that.

	     Allow the name->address mapping for static DHCP leases to
	     be set by /etc/hosts. It's now possible to have
     	        dhcp-host=<mac addr>,wibble
	     or even
                dhcp-host=wibble
	     and in /etc/hosts have
	        wibble 1.2.3.4
	     and for the correct thing to happen. Note that some sort
	     of dhcp-host line is still needed, it's not possible for
	     random host to claim an address in /etc/hosts without
	     some explicit configuration.

	     Make 0.0.0.0 in a dhcp-option to mean "the machine
	     running dnsmasq".
    		    
             Fix lease time spec when specified in dhcp-range and not
	     in dhcp-host, previously this was always one hour.

             Fix problem with setting domains as "local only". -
             thanks to Chris Schank.

	     Added support for max message size DHCP option.

release 2.2
             Fix total lack for DHCP functionality on
	     Linux systems with IPv6 enabled. - thanks to
	     Jonathon Hudson for spotting that.

	     Move default config file under FreeBSD - patch from
	     Steven Honson 

release 2.3
             Fix "install" makefile target. (reported by Rob Stevens)

	     Ensure that "local=/domain/" flag is obeyed for all
	     queries on a domain, not just A and AAAA. (Reported by
	     Peter Fichtner.)

	     Handle DHCPDECLINE messages and provide an error message
	     in DHCPNAK messages.
	     
	     Add "domain" setting example to
	     dnsmasq.conf.example. Thanks to K P Kirchdorfer for
	     spotting that it was missing.

	     Subtle change to the DHCPREQUEST handling code to work
	     around a bug in the DHCP client in HP Jetdirect printers.
	     Thanks to Marko Stolle for finding this problem.

	     Return DHCP T1 and T2 times, with "fuzz" to desychronise lease
	     renewals, as specified in the RFC.
	     
	     Ensure that the END option is always present in DHCP
	     packets , even if the packet is too small to fit all 
	     the requested options.

	     Handle larger-than-default DHCP packets if required, up
	     to the ethernet MTU.

	     Fix a couple of places where the return code from
	     malloc() was not checked.

	     Cope with a machine taking a DHCP lease and then moving
	     network so that the lease address is no longer valid.

	     The DHCP server will now work via a BOOTP relay - remote
	     networks are configured with the dhcp-range option the
	     same as directly connected ones, but they need an
	     additional netmask parameter. Eg
	     --dhcp-range=192.168.4.10,192.168.4.50,255.255,255.0
             will enable DHCP service via a BOOTP relay on the
	     192.168.4.0 network. 

	     Add a limit on the number of available DHCP leases,
	     otherwise the daemon could be DOSed by a malicious
	     host. The default is 150, but it can be changed by the 
	     dhcp-lease-max option.

	     Fixed compilation on OpenBSD (thanks to Frederic Brodbeck
	     for help with that.)
	     
	     Reworked the DHCP network handling code for two good
	     effects: (1) The limit of one network only for DHCP on
	     FreeBSD is now gone, (2) The DHCP server copes with
	     dynamically created interfaces. The one-interface
	     limitation remains for OpenBSD, which is missing
	     extensions to the socket API which have been in Linux
	     since version 2.2 and FreeBSD since version 4.8.

	     Reworked the DNS network code to also cope with
	     dynamically created interfaces. dnsmasq will now listen
	     to the wildcard address and port 53 by default, so if no
	     --interface or --address options are given it will handle
	     dynamically created interfaces. The old behaviour can be
	     restored with --bind-interfaces for people running BIND
	     on one interface and dnsmasq on another. Note that
	     --interface and --address options still work, but the
	     filtering is done by dnsmasq, rather then the kernel.
	     This works on Linux, and FreeBSD>=5.0. On systems which
	     don't support the required API extensions, the old 
	     behaviour is used, just as if --bind-interfaces had been set.

	     Allow IPv6 support to be disabled at compile time. To do
	     that, add -DNO_IPV6 to the CFLAGS. Thanks to Oleg
	     I. Vdovikin for the suggestion to do that.

	     Add ability to set DHCP options per network. This is done
	     by giving a network an identifier like this:
	     dhcp-range=red-net,192.168.0.10,192.168.0.50
	     and then labeling options intended for that network only
	     like this:
	     dhcp-option=red-net,6,1.1.1.1
	     Thanks to Oleg Vdovikin for arguing that one through.

	     Made errors in the configuration file non-fatal: dnsmasq
	     will now complain bitterly, but continue.

	     Added --read-ethers option, to allow dnsmasq to pull
	     static DHCP information from that file. 
	     Thanks to Andi Cambeis for that suggestion.

	     Added HAVE_BROKEN_RTC compilation option to support
	     embedded systems without a stable RTC. Oleg Vdovikin
	     helped work out how to make that work.

release 2.4
	     Fixed inability to start when the lease file doesn't
	     already exist. Thanks to Dag Wieers for reporting that.

	     Fixed problem were dhcp-host configuration options did
	     not play well with entries in /etc/ethers for the same
	     host. Thanks again to Dag Wieers.

	     Tweaked DHCP code to favour moving to a newly-configured
	     static IP address rather than an old lease when doing
	     DHCP allocation.

	     Added --alias configuration option. This provides IPv4
	     rewrite facilities like Cisco "DNS doctoring". Suggested
	     by Chad Skeeters.

	     Fixed bug in /etc/ethers parsing code triggered by tab
	     characters. Qudos to Dag Wieers for hepling to nail that
	     one.
 	     
	     Added "bind-interfaces" option correctly.	     

release 2.5
	     Made "where are we allocating addresses?" code in DHCP
	     server cope with requests via a relay which is on a
	     directly connected network for which there is not a
	     configured netmask. This strange state of affairs occurs
	     with win4lin. Thanks to Alex Melt and Jim Horner for bug
	     reports and testing with this. 

	     Fixed trivial-but-irritating missing #include which broke
	     compilation on *BSD.

	     Force --bind-interfaces if IP-aliased interface
	     specifications are used, since the sockets API provides
	     no other sane way to determine which alias of an
	     interface a packet was sent to. Thanks to Javier Kohen
	     for the bug report.

release 2.6 
	     Support Token Ring DHCP. Thanks to Dag Wieers for help
	     testing. Note that Token ring support only works on Linux 
	     currently.

	     Fix compilation on MacOS X. Thanks to Bernhard Ehlers for
	     the patch.

	     Added new "ignore" keyword for
	     dhcp-host. "dhcp-host=11:22:33:44:55:66,ignore" will
	     cause the DHCP server to ignore any host with the given
	     MAC address, leaving it to other servers on the
	     network. This also works with client-id and hostnames.
	     Suggestion by Alex Melt.

	     Fixed parsing of hex client IDs. Problem spotted by Peter
	     Fichtner.

	     Allow conf-file options in configuration file, to
	     provide an include function.
	     
	     Re-read /etc/ethers on receipt of SIGHUP.

	     Added back the ability to read ISC dhcpd lease files, by
	     popular demand. Note that this is deprecated and for
	     backwards compatibility only. You can get back the 4K of
	     memory that the code occupies by undefining
	     "HAVE_ISC_READER" in src/config.h

	     Added ability to disable "pool" DHCP address allocation
	     whilst leaving static leases working. The syntax is
	     "dhcp-range=192.168.0.0,static"
	     Thanks to Grzegorz Nosek for the suggestion.

	     Generalized dnsmasq-rh.spec file to work on Mandrake too,
	     and removed dnsmasq-mdk.spec. Thanks to Doug Keller.

	     Allow DHCP options which are tied to specific static
	     leases in the same way as to specific networks.

	     Generalised the dhcp-option parser a bit to allow hex
	     strings as parameters. This is now legal:
	     dhcp-option=128,e4:45:74:68:00:00
	     Inspired by a patch from Joel Nordell.

	     Changed the semantics of argument-less dhcp-options for
	     the default-setting ones, ie 1, 3, 6 and 28. Now, doing
	     eg, dhcp-option=3 stops dnsmasq from sending a default
	     router option at all. Thanks to Scott Emmons for pointing
	     out that this is useful.

	     Fixed dnsmasq.conf parsing bug which interpreted port
	     numbers in server= lines as a comment. To start a
	     comment, a '#' character must now be a the start of a
	     line or preceded by whitespace. Thanks to Christian
	     Haggstrom for the bug report.

release 2.7  
             Allow the dhcp-host specification of id:* which makes 
	     dnsmasq ignore any client-id. This is useful to ensure 
	     that a dual-boot machine sees the same lease when one OS 
	     gives a client-id and the other doesn't. It's also useful
	     when PXE boot DHCP does not use client IDs but the OS it boots 
             does. Thanks to Grzegorz Nosek for suggesting this enhancement.

	     No longer assume that ciaddr is zero in received DHCPDISCOVER 
	     messages, just for security against broken clients.

	     Set default of siaddr field to the address of the machine running 
             dnsmasq when not explicitly set using dhcp-boot
             option. This is the ISC dhcpd behaviour.  

             Send T1 and T2 options in DHCPOFFER packets. This is required
	     by the DHCP client in some JetDirect printers. Thanks 
             to Paul Mattal for work on this.

	     Fixed bug with DHCP on OpenBSD reported by Dominique Jacquel.
	     The code which added loopback interfaces to the list
	     was confusing the DHCP code, which expected one interface only.
	     Solved by adding loopback interfaces to address list instead.

	     Add dhcp-vendorclass option to allow options to be sent only
	     to certain classes of clients.

	     Tweaked option search code so that if a netid-qualified
	     option is used, any unqualified option is ignored.
	     
	     Changed the method of picking new dynamic IP
	     addresses. This used to use the next consecutive
	     address as long it was free, now it uses a hash
	     from the client hardware address. This reduces the amount
	     of address movement for clients which let their lease
	     expire and allows consecutive DHCPOFFERS to the same host
	     to (almost always) be for the same address, without
	     storing state before a lease is granted.
 
	     Tweaked option handling code to return all possible
	     options rather than none when DHCP "requested options"
	     field is missing. This fixes interoperability with
	     ancient IBM LANMAN DHCP clients. Thanks to Jim Louvau for
	     help with this.

release 2.8
	     Pad DHCP packets to a minimum size of 300 bytes. This
	     fixes interoperability problems with the Linux in-kernel
	     DHCP/BOOTP client. Thanks to Richard Musil for
	     diagnosing this and supplying a patch.

	     Fixed option-parsing bug and potential memory leak. Patch
	     from Richard Musil.

	     Improved vendor class configuration and added user class
	     configuration. Specifically: (1) options are matched on
	     the netids from dhcp-range, dhcp-host, vendor class and
	     user class(es). Multiple net-ids are allowed and options
	     are searched on them all. (2) matches agains vendor class
	     and user class are now on a substring, if the given
	     string is a substring of the vendor/user class, then a
	     match occurs. Thanks again to Richard Musil for prompting
	     this.

	     Make "#" match any domain on --address and --server
	     flags. --address=/#/1.2.3.4 will return 1.2.3.4 for _any_
	     domain not otherwise matched. Of course
	     --server=/#/1.2.3.4 is exactly equivalent to
	     --server=1.2.3.4. Special request from Josh Howlett.
	
	     Fixed a nasty bug which would cause dnsmasq to lose track
	     of leases for hosts which had a --dhcp-host flag without
	     a name specification. The mechanism for this was that
	     the hostname could get erroneously set as a zero-length
	     string and then written to the leases file as a
	     mal-formed line. Restarting dnsmasq would then lose the lease.
	     Alex Hermann's work helped chase down this problem.

	     Add checks against DHCP clients which return zero-length
	     hostnames. This avoids the potential lease-loss problems
	     reffered to above. Also, if a client sends a hostname when
	     it creates a lease but subsequently sends no or a
	     zero-length hostname whilst renewing, continue to use the
	     existing hostname, don't wipe it out. 
	     
	     Tweaked option parsing to flag some parameter errors.

release 2.9
	     Fixed interface filter code for two effects: 1) Fixed bug
	     where queries sent via loopback interface
	     but to the address of another interface were ignored
	     unless the loopback interface was explicitly configured.
	     2) on OpenBSD failure to configure one interface now
	     causes a fatal error on startup rather than an huge
	     stream of log messages. Thanks to Erik Jan Tromp for 
	     finding that bug.

	     Changed server selection strategy to improve performance
	     when there are many available servers and some are
	     broken. The new algorithm is to pick as before for the
	     first try, but if a query is retried, to send to all
	     available servers in parallel. The first one to reply
	     then becomes prefered for the next query. This should 
	     improve reliability without generating significant extra
	     upstream load.

	     Fixed breakage of special servers/addresses for
	     unqualified domains introduced in version 2.8 
	      
	     Allow fallback to "bind-interfaces" at runtime: Some
	     verions of *BSD seem to have enough stuff in the header
	     files to build but no kernel support. Also now log if
	     "bind-interfaces" is forced on.

	     Log replies from upstream servers which refuse to do
	     recursion - dnsmasq is not a recursive nameserver and
	     relies on upstream servers to do the recursion, this
	     flags a configuration error.

	     Disable client-id matching for hosts whose MAC address is
	     read from /etc/ethers. Patch from Oleg I. Vdovikin.

	     Extended --mx-host flag to allow arbitrary targets for MX
	     records, suggested by Moritz Bunkus.

	     Fixed build under NetBSD 2.0 - thanks to Felix Deichmann
	     for the patch.
	     
	     Deal correctly with repeated addresses in /etc/hosts. The
	     first name found is now returned for reverse lookups,
	     rather than all of them.

	     Add back fatal errors when nonexistant 
	     interfaces or interface addresses are given but only in
	     "bind-interfaces" mode. Principle of least surprise applies.
	     
	     Allow # as the argument to --domain, meaning "read the
	     domain from the first search directive in
	     /etc.resolv.conf". Feature suggested by Evan Jones.

release 2.10
	    Allow --query-port to be set to a low port by creating and
	    binding the socket before dropping root. (Suggestion from
	    Jamie Lokier) 

	    Support TCP queries. It turned out to be possible to do
	    this with a couple of hundred lines of code, once I knew
	    how. The executable size went up by a few K on i386.
	    There are a few limitations: data obtained via TCP is not
	    cached, and dynamically-created interfaces may break under
	    certain circumstances. Source-address or query-port
	    specifications are ignored for TCP.

	    NAK attempts to renew a DHCP lease where the DHCP range
	    has changed and the lease is no longer in the allowed
	    range. Jamie Lokier pointed out this bug.

	    NAK attempts to renew a pool DHCP lease when a statically
	    allocated address has become available, forcing a host to
	    move to it's allocated address. Lots of people have
	    suggested this change and been rebuffed (they know who
	    they are) the straws that broke the camel's back were Tim
	    Cutts and Jamie Lokier.

	    Remove any nameserver records from answers which are
	    modified by --alias flags. If the answer is modified, it
	    cannot any longer be authoritative.

	    Change behaviour of "bogus-priv" option to return NXDOMAIN
	    rather than a PTR record with the dotted-quad address as
	    name. The new behaviour doesn't provoke tcpwrappers like
	    the old behavior did.

	    Added a patch for the Suse rpm. That changes the default
	    group to one suitable for Suse and disables inclusion of
	    the ISC lease-file reader code. Thanks to Andy Cambeis for
	    his ongoing work on Suse packaging.

	    Support forwarding of EDNS.0 The maximum UDP packet size 
	    defaults to 1280, but may be changed with the
	    --edns-packet-max option. Detect queries with the do bit
	    set and always forward them, since DNSSEC records are 
	    not cached. This behaviour is required to make
	    DNSSECbis work properly though dnsmasq. Thanks to Simon
	    Josefsson for help with this.

	    Move default config file location under OpenBSD from
	    /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf to /etc/dnsmasq.conf. Bug
	    report from Jonathan Weiss.

	    Use a lease with matching MAC address for a host which
	    doesn't present a client-id, even if there was a client ID 
	    at some point in the past. This reduces surprises when
	    changing DHCP clients, adding id:* to a host, and from the
	    semantics change of /etc/ethers in 2.9. Thanks to Bernard
	    Sammer for finding that.

	    Added a "contrib" directory and in it the dnslist utility,
	    from Thomas Tuttle.

	    Fixed "fail to start up" problems under Linux with IPv6
	    enabled. It's not clear that these were an issue in
	    released versions, but they manifested themselves when TCP
	    support was added. Thanks to Michael Hamilton for
	    assistance with this.

version 2.11
	    Fixed DHCP problem which could result in two leases in the
            database with the same address. This looked much more
            alarming then it was, since it could only happen when a
            machine changes MAC address but kept the same name. The
            old lease would persist until it timed out but things
            would still work OK. 

	    Check that IP addresses in all dhcp-host directives are
	    unique and die horribly if they are not, since otherwise
	    endless protocol loops can occur. 
	    
	    Use IPV6_RECVPKTINFO as socket option rather than
	    IPV6_PKTINFO where available. This keeps late-model FreeBSD
	    happy.

	    Set source interface when replying to IPv6 UDP
	    queries. This is needed to cope with link-local addresses.

version 2.12
            Added extra checks to ensure that DHCP created DNS entries 
	    cannot generate multiple DNS address->name entries. Thanks to 
	    Stefan Monnier for finding the exact set of configuration
            options which could create this.

	    Don't set the the filterwin2k option in the example config
	    file and add warnings that is breaks Kerberos. Thanks to
	    Simon Josefsson and Timothy Folks for pointing that out.
	    
	    Log types of incoming queries as well as source and domain.

	    Log NODATA replies generated as a result of the
	    filterwin2k option.

version 2.13
	    Fixed crash with un-named DHCP hosts introduced in 2.12.
	    Thanks to Nicolo Wojewoda and Gregory Gathy for bug reports.

version 2.14
	    Fix DHCP network detection for hosts which talk via a
	    relay. This makes lease renewal for such hosts work
	    correctly.

	    Support RFC3011 subnet selectors in the DHCP server.

	    Fix DHCP code to generate RFC-compliant responses
            to hosts in the INIT-REBOOT state.

	    In the DHCP server, set the receive buffer size on 
	    the transmit-only packet socket to zero, to avoid 
	    waste of kernel buffers.

	    Fix DHCP address allocation code to use the whole of
	    the DHCP range, including the start and end addresses.
	    
	    Attempt an ICMP "ping" on new addresses before allocating 
	    them to leases, to avoid allocating addresses which are in use.

	    Handle rfc951 BOOTP as well as DHCP for hosts which have
	    MAC address to IP address mapping defined.

	    Fix compilation under MacOS X. Thanks to Chris Tomlinson.

	    Fix compilation under NetBSD. Thanks to Felix Deichmann.

	    Added "keep-in-foreground" option. Thanks to Sean
	    MacLennan for the patch.

version 2.15
            Fixed NXDOMAIN/NODATA confusion for locally known
            names. We now return a NODATA reponse for names which are
            locally known. Now a query for (eg AAAA or MX) for a name
	    with an IPv4 address in /etc/hosts which fails upstream
            will generate a NODATA response. Note that the query 
	    is still tried upstream, but a NXDOMAIN reply gets
            converted to NODATA. Thanks to Eric de Thouars, Eric
            Spakman and Mike Mestnik for bug reports/testing.

	    Allow multiple dhcp-ranges within the same network. The
	    original intention was that there would be a dhcp-range
	    option for each network served, but there's no real reason
	    not to allow discontinuous ranges within a network so this
	    release adds support for that.

	    Check for dhcp-ranges which are inconsistent with their 
	    netmask, and generate errors or warnings.
	    
	    Improve error messages when there are problems with
	    configuration.
