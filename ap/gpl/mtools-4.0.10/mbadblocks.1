.SH Description
.PP
The \fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR command is used to scan an MS-DOS floppy and mark
its unused bad blocks as bad. It uses the following syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR \fIdrive\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR
.iX "p mbadblocks"
.iX "c Marking blocks as bad"
.iX "c Bad blocks"
.iX "c Read errors"
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR scans an MS-DOS floppy for bad blocks. All unused bad
blocks are marked as such in the FAT. This is intended to be used right
after \fR\&\f(CWmformat\fR.  It is not intended to salvage bad disks.
.SH Bugs
\&\fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR should (but doesn't yet :-( ) also try to salvage bad
blocks which are in use by reading them repeatedly, and then mark them
bad.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo
documentation. However, this process is only approximative, and some
items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are lost in this
translation process.  Indeed, these items have no appropriate
representation in the manpage format.  Moreover, not all information has
been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to
use the original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for
instructions how to view the texinfo doc.

The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examples are difficult to read due to the
quoting conventions used in info.
