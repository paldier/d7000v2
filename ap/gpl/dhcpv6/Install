* Install
    After downloading the tar ball, "configure" to create Makefile 
    and "make" to compile.
    For RedHat system, "# make rh_install" is convenient.
    For other systems, "# make install" to install dhcp6s/dhcp6c.

* Starting dhcpv6 server
    1. edit /etc/dhcp6s.conf
        We provide a template file. (dhsp6s.conf)
        Write general configuration of dhcp6s here.
    2. edit /etc/server6_addr.conf
        We provide a template file. (server6_addr.conf)
        Specify the address space which dhcp6s can lease.
    3. edit /etc/sysconfig/dhcp6s
        We provide a template file. (dhcp6s.sysconfig)
        Specify the interface where dhcp6s runs.
    # if you are not using RedHat system, edit the dhcp6s.sh.
    # And copy the dhcp6s.sh to your init directory.
    4. start dhcp6s
        "/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp6s start" or "dhcp6s.sh start" 
        will start dhcp6s.
    5. stop dhcp6s
        "/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp6s stop" or "dhcp6s.sh stop"
        will start dhcp6s.

* Starting dhcpv6 client
    1. edit /etc/dhcp6c.conf
        We provide a template file. (dhsp6c.conf)
        Write general configuration of dhcp6c here.
    2. edit /etc/sysconfig/dhcp6c
        We provide a template file. (dhcp6c.sysconfig)
        Specify the interface where dhcp6c runs.
    # if you are not using RedHat system, edit the dhcp6c.sh.
    # And copy the dhcp6c.sh to your init directory.
    4. start dhcp6c
        "/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp6c start" will start dhcp6c.
    5. stop dhcp6c
        "/etc/rc.d/init.d/dhcp6c stop" will start dhcp6c.

* Uninstall
    For RedHat system, "# make rh_uninstall" is convenient.
    For other systems, "# make uninstall" to install dhcp6s/dhcp6c.
    This procedure doesn't delete any configuration information.
