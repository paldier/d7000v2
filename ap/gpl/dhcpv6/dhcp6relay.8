.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Ddf
.Op Fl H Ar hoplim
.Ar interface
.\"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
acts as an intermediary to deliver DHCPv6 messages between clients and
servers, and is on the same link as a client.
.\"
.Nm
needs a command line argument
.Ar interface ,
which specifies the link.
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Print debugging messages.
.It Fl D
Even more debugging information is printed.

it prints the messages to standard error if this option is
specified.
.It Fl H Ar hoplim
The option specifies the hop limit of DHCPv6 Solicit messages forwarded to
servers.
