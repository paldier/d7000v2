zeroconf-0.9:
	correctly handled address conflicts and don't loop indefinately
	in ADDR_FINAL (thanks to Claus Klein)

	correctly test for ARP conflicts (thanks to Claus Klein)

	if the interface disappears, so do we

	if an interface with the same name (but new number) appears, use the
	new number

	only send probes when changes on our interface occur not for changes
	on any interface

	if another zeroconf instance is started on our interface (or the admin
	assign an address manually) exit

	close unnecessary file descriptors (we were holding /dev open for
	example)

	Add a manual page (Thanks for thijs Kinkhorst)

zeroconf-0.8:
	complete rewrite to speak netlink natively
