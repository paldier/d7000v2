How to implement?


   All ARP packets (*replies* as well as requests) that contain a Link-
   Local 'sender IP address' MUST be sent using link-layer broadcast
   instead of link-layer unicast.  This aids timely detection of
   duplicate addresses.  An example illustrating how this helps is given
   in Section 4.

From section 2.6? Change the kernel to know about these addresses?

Or section 2.6.2? If only a single IPv4LL address per machine, then a
route entry is fine.  If not routable address but with have link-local
and are trying to communicate with non link-local, MUST ARP for
address

Section 2.7:
	no forwarding of IPv4LL addresses
