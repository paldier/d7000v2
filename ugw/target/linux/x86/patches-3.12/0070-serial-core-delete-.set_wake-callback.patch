Subject: [PATCH] serial: core: delete .set_wake() callback

This deletes the .set_wake() callback in the struct uart_ops.
Apparently this has been unused since pre-git times. In the
old-2.6-bkcvs it is deleted as part of a changeset removing
the PM_SET_WAKEUP from pm_request_t which is since also deleted
from the kernel.

The apropriate way to set wakeups in the kernel is to have a
code snippet like this in .suspend() or .runtime_suspend()
callbacks:

static int foo_suspend(struct device *dev)
{
	if (device_may_wakeup(dev)) {
		/* Enable wakeups, set internal states */
	}
}

This specific callback is not coming back.
